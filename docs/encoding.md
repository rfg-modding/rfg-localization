# Encoding .rfglocatext files
To convert an XML file back into the `.rfglocatext` format, drag-and-drop the file onto the program. Optionally, run the following within a command line:

`rfg-localization.exe <input>`

Similar to decoding, an output path can be specified for the file. For more details, refer to the [Decoding](decoding.md?id=specifying-output-file-optional) page.

It is recommended to use [SyncFaction](https://rfg-modding.github.io/SyncFaction) to repack modified `.rfglocatext` files into the game, rather than manually repacking a `.vpp_pc` file.
